When you get a chance, and if possible, can you please add 3 columns
-	One with the SSO ID of the author of the idea (title “Author SSO ID”)
-	Another with the voter’s. (title “Voter SSO ID”)
I used the name to match some data with complete list of the Community members have. But the names are sometimes a problem as they contain non ASCII characters in one list and converted characters in another. SSO ID should be less problematic to use. 
-	A third with the email of the author of the idea (title “Author Email”)

Also , if possible, pls change the column title 
-	“Author“ to “Idea Author”
-	“Post Date” to “Idea Date”
-	“Email” to “Voter Email”
